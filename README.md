# homebridge-sengled-bulbs (Beta)

An unoffical [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) platform plugin for Sengled accessories.

This plugin uses the existing Sengled Element Home app infrastructure to allow you to control your Sengled accessories that uses zigbee. It'll let you turn on/off the lights and control brightness and color temperature using the Home app.

Provide your username and password and register as a platform, and it will auto-detect the light bulb you have registered.

Note that I only have **Element Classic A19 Kit (Light bulbs + Hub)** to test  
https://us.sengled.com/products/element-classic-kit
